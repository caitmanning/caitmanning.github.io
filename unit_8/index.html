				<p>Wanderlust isn't just a word to me, it's a way of life. These are just a few stories of how I experience it. My name is Caitlyn, I am 65% sarcasm, 20% artistic, 10% comedian, and 5% scholar. I am also 100% a wanderlust soul, always moving always looking for the new adventure. I started giving my mom grey haris at age 5 and haven't looked back. I hope my writing inspires others to travel and see the world.</p>
