				<h2>My First Cruise &#9992;</h2>
				<p>I have traveled more in the last several weeks than I have in my entire life. Yesterday was the end of that journey and me coming home for the first time in 4 weeks.  The moment I step foot back in this country I thought about my stay in Italy, I thought of the memories I made, and the friendships I now possess because of the Roman Death march, the day in Pompeii, and the bus ride from hell. Now, I do not believe in magic but I do believe in a moment in time being so extravagant that it is magical, that it is too perfect that you can&#x0027;t describe it. It is a time where nothing can get any better and everyone is happy, it is a moment that you realize that you are in the greatest place your eyes have ever seen. It is memories and days that are better than most of what your life has given you. Everyone that I was with had gone through different things in their life, some bad some good, but no matter what everyone was so caring and loving. Which made the trip better. Our professors said that we had the best group they have ever seen, the way we bonded and cared for each other was incredible. I never once felt unsafe or just homesick, because I knew the moment I felt that way I would have someone with their arm around me to tell all the Italian men not to bother me, or  a shoulder to lean on when the sad thoughts of leaving mad my head to heavy to carry on my own. These people are more than friends they are family, because family isn&#x0027;t always blood, it&#x0027;s knowing someone better than most and still loving them no matter what. That is family.  I will never forget anyone from this trip and I hope they never forget me, at least not who I was, they can forget my name, what I looked like, but I hope they remember me for who I was, and who I was to them. I once said the day I change someones life and outlook on everything is the day I can die happy. That is what I would like to be remembered for, not that I expect to have changed someones life, but that they remember me for always being happy, or just my personality. I hope that I am as special to them as they are to me.</p>
